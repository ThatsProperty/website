    <h1>Terms and Conditions for ThatsProperty.ai</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai is a trading name of Interition Digital Transformation Ltd (Company number 12852453), registered in England. By accessing or using the ThatsProperty.ai website and services, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Overview</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai provides a podcast service that delivers information related to UK property based on a user-supplied postcode. The service uses AI agents to gather public information, and this information is used to generate a podcast for the user. As this is an early release, the service will evolve based on user feedback.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility & Use</h2>
    <p>The service is available to individuals without age restrictions. It is limited to properties located in the United Kingdom. Users may only request one podcast per postcode per subscription. By using the service, you agree to fact-check any claims made in the podcast and acknowledge the limitations of AI-generated content.</p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Users must not duplicate the website or the service, use it for illegal or unauthorized purposes, or resell, redistribute, or publish the podcast content on social media or any digital platform where it can be accessed by anyone other than themselves. The podcast content is solely for the purpose of informing the user personally.</p>

    <h2>5. Payments & Fees</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai uses Stripe for all payment services. Users must subscribe to the service after a free 60-day trial. The podcast will be delivered to the email address provided during the subscription process, with the postcode for the podcast subject also collected at that time. The service is non-refundable. Subscription can be cancelled at any time through the <a href="https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/eVag34bAm43qftK000/">stripe customer portal</a>, and upon cancellation, the service will terminate immediately. Podcasts are delivered within 48 hours of entering a subscription and will be delivered monthly thereafter. </p>

    <h2>6. Service Availability & Support</h2>
    <p>We aim to deliver podcasts within 48 hours of subscription and on a monthly basis. Support is available by emailing podcasts@thatsproperty.com, with a target response time of 48 hours (Monday-Friday, 9am-4pm UK time). Additional support is available through our <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/thatsproperty-podcast" class="footer-link">Google Group</a>. However, we do not guarantee resolution of any issues, and we specifically cannot assist with the information delivered in the podcast.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai reserves the right to terminate the service at any time without explanation. Users may cancel their subscription at any time, after which the service will terminate immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Privacy & Data</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai does not collect any personal data other than the information provided to Stripe. Stripe stores the postcode for the subject of the podcast, the user’s email address, and billing information. Users can manage all personal data through the Stripe customer portal.</p>

    <h2>9. Liability & Indemnity</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai accepts no liability for any loss, damage, or inaccuracies in the podcast or service. Users are responsible for fact-checking any information provided in the podcast. We accept no liability for any issues arising from the use or reliance on the podcast content.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the United Kingdom. We do not have any specific preferences for how disputes will be resolved.</p>

    <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time. Any changes will be posted on the website, and it is the user’s responsibility to review the terms periodically.</p>
