    <h2>2. Service Overview</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai provides a podcast service that delivers information related to UK property based on a
        postcode provided by you. The service uses AI agents to gather public information, and this information is used
        to
        generate a podcast for you. As this is an early release, the service will evolve based on user feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility & Use</h2>
    <p>You can be any age to use this service. It is limited to properties located in the
        United Kingdom. You may only request one podcast per postcode per subscription. By using the service, you
        agree that, where the podcast may bring to your attention certain information of concern, you should verify any
        information yourself. The data sources used to generate the podcast content can be obtained from our <a
            href="https://groups.google.com/g/thatsproperty-podcast" class="footer-link">Google Group</a> or our <a href="https://discord.gg/wzbQTQkstv"

        anyone other than yourself. The podcast content is solely for the purpose of informing yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payments & Fees</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai uses Stripe for all payment services. You must subscribe to the service after a free 60-day

        cancelled at any time through the <a href="https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/eVag34bAm43qftK000/">stripe
            customer portal</a>, and upon cancellation, the service will terminate immediately. </p>

    <h2>6. Service Availability & Support</h2>
    <p>The podcast will be delivered to the email address provided during the subscription process, with the
        postcode for the podcast content also collected at that time. We aim to deliver podcasts within 48 hours of
        subscription and on a monthly basis. Support is available by

    <h2>8. Privacy & Data</h2>
    <p>ThatsProperty.ai stores the postcode for the subject of the podcast, your email address, and billing
        information. We use the
        postcode provided
        to find data and create the audio for the podcast. We use the email address provided to send the podcast to you.
        We maintain a database of the emails we send to all users for a period of 18 months. We may use the emails to
        provide you with
        information about your subscription or account with us and to inform you of new features and services related to
        your use of this service.
        You can manage
        all personal data through the Stripe customer portal and you can make specific requests regarding your data to

        content is not available.
